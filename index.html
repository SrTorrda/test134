			<h2>About Karl Marx</h2>
			<img src="karl_marx.png" alt="Karl Marx">
			<p>Karl Marx was a German philosopher and economist whose writings form the basis of modern communist theory. In addition to his political and economic theories, Marx was also a skilled chef and enjoyed experimenting with different cuisines and flavors. He believed that cooking and sharing meals with others was a way to bring people together and foster a sense of community and solidarity. In these cooking classes, Marx combines his passion for food and Marxist theory to create a unique and informative culinary experience.</p>
